# flutter_bloc_crud

## Getting Started

This project is based on CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) using [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) and [Formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz) 

## Facts

- A very minimal user experience based application so that I can build a good foundation on flutter_bloc and formz concepts 😵‍💫
- Have used [Formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz) in this application just to get what the hype is about! 🔭
- Try to follow feature-driven application structure and have extensively used barrel file generator 🗂
